This is a IoT plant monitor device that reads the soil moisture content, temperature and lighting conditions of a plant then via bluetooth 
relays the message to a smartphone or PC based bluetooth enabled device as the plant being "happy or sad". This first iteration utilizes a dsPIC DSP and runs on NiMh 
batteries.

The information about the plant is also displayed on an OLED attached to the microcontroller, which displays "happy" or "sad" along with
an image of the mood of the plant and tells the user if it is too dark or there is not enough water in the plant.
